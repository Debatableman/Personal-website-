        <p>
          I'am a new student at BCIT campus and learning CIT as a fresh start on
          academic. I want to study harder and find out what I'am good at in
          academic, it will be <em>difficult</em> and <em>tough</em> for the
          long run, but I believe it will be <strong>worth the effort</strong>.
          I was born in <em>China</em>, and I love meeting new people and making
          new connection if possible. I live with my parents, and I don't have
          any siblings. I would love to own a <em>puppy</em> one day.
        </p>

          One of my favorite food is pizza, and I love playing video games when
          I was young. I wish myself a <strong>good luck</strong> starting a new beginning at
          BCIT, and I hope to do a <strong>good job</strong> before the semester
          ends.
