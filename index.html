        <article>
            <p>I'am a new student at BCIT campus and learning CIT as a fresh start on academic.
               I want to study harder and find out what I'am good at in academic,
               it will be <em>difficult</em> and <em>tough</em> for the long run, but I believe it will be <strong>worth the effort</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>I was born in <em>China</em>, and I love meeting new people and making new connection if possible.
                I live with my parents, and I don't have any siblings. I would love to own a <em>puppy</em> one day.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favorite food is pizza, and I love playing video games when I was young.
            </p>
            <p>I wish myself a <strong>good luck</strong> starting a new beginning at BCIT, and I hope to do a <strong>good job</strong> before the semester ends.</p>
